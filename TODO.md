Bugz

* [ ] when posting article, if code crashes after initial post, article draft is left at the Wordpress server.
* [ ] different posts that link to same image create multiple media library entries for that same image.


Just a list of things worth looking into.

* [ ] should engine be reusable or should it be created new for each theme/layout combination?
